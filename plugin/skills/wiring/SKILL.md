# Wiring

`stack.style` in `ddd-ts-kit.config.json` says which style the project uses. Exact API:
README of `@ddd-ts-kit/di`. The generators write all of this; read here what to do when you
change it by hand. Below are the ports and the declared style; on another stack, read its file
first:

- under `stack.style: explicit`, read [explicit.md](explicit.md) first: every binding is written
  in the module file, the only file of a context allowed to know every layer
  (`composition/only-in-module`);
- under `stack.http: nest`, read [nest.md](nest.md) first: the rest of Nest's request pipeline
  (controllers, guards, pipes, exception filters, interceptors) stays out of every context
  (`nest/no-parallel-pipeline`), and the file says where each tool of Nest goes;
- under `stack.dependencies: listed`, or when `declarations/barrel-current` reports declarations
  an earlier version wrote, read [earlier-layouts.md](earlier-layouts.md) first.

## Ports, in both styles

- A port is an **abstract class with abstract members only**, one per file:
  `domain/repositories/<name>.repository.ts` (extends the kernel `Repository<Aggregate>`) or
  `application/ports/<name>.port.ts`. The class is the contract **and** the injection token:
  no constant, no `token()`, no `*.ports.ts` file (`ports/abstract-class`,
  `ports/no-token-constant`).
- An adapter `implements` its port, never `extends` it (`ports/implements-never-extends`).
- A class of `infrastructure/` that implements a port is wired, by its declaration or by a
  binding in the composition root; one kept unwired on purpose says so above the class,
  `// ddd-ts-kit-disable-next-line declarations/port-adapter-wired -- ADR-NNNN: <why>`, with its
  decision record in `docs/adr/` (`declarations/port-adapter-wired`).
- A dependency is named by the class of its port, never by an adapter or a fake
  (`ports/no-concrete-dependency`). Where a list is written (the explicit style, a
  `bind(Port)`), the port is imported as a value (`ports/value-import`).
- A value that is not a port (settings, a database handle) is carried the same way: an
  abstract class with readonly members, bound to a plain object in the platform.
- A fake of `test/fakes/` is bound in tests only. An outside system the application runs
  without (a sandbox, a demo) gets a simulated adapter instead,
  `npx ddd-ts-kit generate adapter <ctx> <Port> --kind simulated`: production code under
  `infrastructure/external/`, bound to the port like any adapter (kind `external`). A port has
  one adapter, so the simulated one and the remote one take turns; nothing picks one per
  environment.

## Declared style (default with tsyringe)

A class says what it is on its own file, and that is its registration. There is no
`<context>.module.ts`.

| Class | Decorator of `@ddd-ts-kit/kernel/declarations` |
|---|---|
| command, query | `@Requires(permission)` or `@Public()` |
| handler | `@CommandHandler(Message)`, `@QueryHandler(Message)` |
| reaction to a domain event, publisher | `@DomainEventHandler(Event)`, attached under the `static readonly eventName` of the event class; `{ phase: 'after-commit' }` for an effect outside the transaction (never a publisher) |
| integration event handler | `@IntegrationEventHandler(definition, { consumer })` |
| scheduled job | `@Scheduled('<context>.<job>', { every } or { cron, timeZone })` |
| projector of a read model | `@Projection('<context>.<name>')`, with `@On(definition)` on each method that applies an event |
| policy | `@Policy(permission, { name })` |
| adapter | `@Repository(Port)`, `@Gateway(Port)`, `@Adapter(Port, { kind })` |

- Nothing under `domain/` carries a decorator. Names (`consumer`, `name`) are string literals.
- **The constructor states the dependencies, and nothing repeats it.** Each parameter is
  typed by one class, which is its token: a port, a kernel port (`Clock`, `CommandBus`,
  `Logger`...), another declared class, or an abstract class the platform binds to a value.
  Never a union, an interface, a primitive, `?`, a default value, a rest parameter
  (`declarations/constructor-injection`). A port that only types a parameter is imported with
  `import type`.
- To add a dependency to a handler: add the constructor parameter. Then `npx ddd-ts-kit docs`
  (`npm run dev` does it by itself on every reload). Nothing else, and no list in the
  decorator.
- Each layer holds a generated `<layer>.declarations.ts`
  (`application/application.declarations.ts`; a role folder holds its role files and nothing
  else): one `export *` per role file of the layer, then one
  `injected(Class, [Tokens])` per class whose constructor takes something, read from the source.
  `<context>.declarations.ts` only re-exports these files; the composition root imports it.
  After adding, moving or deleting a role file, or changing a constructor, by hand:
  `npx ddd-ts-kit docs`, which also deletes the declarations of an emptied layer
  (`declarations/barrel-current` names the file and the class whose list is stale). Never edit
  them. With `stack.assembly: discovery` the composition root reads the role files
  itself (`discoverContext`) and the lists from the generated `<context>.dependencies.ts`.
- A context divided into modules of the model (`contexts.<name>.modules`) wires the same way:
  each layer of a module has its own declarations,
  `<module>/application/application.declarations.ts`, re-exported by
  `<context>.declarations.ts` like the others; `discoverContext` reads the modules in the
  generated `<context>.dependencies.ts`, which names them, without the config, and loads the role
  files of each module folder. Declared, a module has no module file: its classes declare themselves. `npx ddd-ts-kit move-to-module` rewrites the declarations it moves.
- `WiringError MISSING_DEPENDENCIES` or `DEPENDENCY_ARITY` at startup: the generated file is
  stale or was not loaded. Run `npx ddd-ts-kit docs`; in a test, assemble the context from its
  generated file (`contextModule('<context>', declarations)`), never from a class imported
  alone.
- Compiler metadata is never used: `emitDecoratorMetadata` is absent with standard
  decorators and under `tsx`. Do not add `reflect-metadata` calls or `@Inject`.
- A value or a factory, which no decorator can say, is bound in
  `src/platform/composition/platform.module.ts` (and its test twin): that file belongs to the platform,
  not to a context.

## Composition root

`src/main.ts` starts tracing first, loads the configuration, opens persistence, then calls
`composeApplication` of `src/platform/composition/compose-application.ts`, where each context is one line
(`contextModule('<context>', declarations)`, or the module of an explicit context) added by
`generate context`. Adapters are instantiated, and declarations assembled, nowhere else
(`composition/only-in-module`). `createApplication` refuses duplicate bindings, missing
dependencies and cycles before anything is instantiated: a `WiringError` names the port and
the module.

Controllers, guards, request mappers and serializers are declared classes too (`@Controller`,
`@Guard`, `@RequestMapper`, `@Serializer` of `@ddd-ts-kit/http`): the generated file of the
context exports them and registers what each constructor takes, and the composition root mounts
every controller with `controllerRoutes(resolve(DeclaredEdges).of('controller'), { resolve })`.
No file lists the routes of a declared context.

## Tests

```ts
const application = createTestApplication({
  modules: [platformTestModule, contextModule('ordering', orderingDeclarations)],
  fakes: [fake(OrderRepository, orders), fake(PaymentGateway, payments)],
});
```

The test application brings a fixed clock, sequential identifiers, in-memory buses, logger,
metrics and error reporter. Replace every adapter that leaves the process by its fake; never
mock a module. When several specs of a context share this arrangement,
`npx ddd-ts-kit generate test-world <ctx>` writes it once, in `test/worlds/`. Details: skill
`ddd-ts-kit:testing`.
