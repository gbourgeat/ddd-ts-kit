export const NOTES = `  affected         what a pull request has to run: the contexts a change set reaches through the context
                   map (a changed context and the contexts downstream of it), as filters for the test
                   runner and the linter; everything when a shared path changed or without --base
  build-aliases    after the compiler: rewrites the import aliases left in the emitted .js and .d.ts files
                   into relative paths, so that plain node runs the output (tsconfig.build.json by default)
  drizzle-generate the db:generate of a Drizzle project: drizzle-kit generate --name, which without a terminal
                   fails and names the fix when drizzle-kit would ask whether a column or table is renamed,
                   where drizzle-kit alone writes nothing and exits 0
  error-factories  moves a project from one class per error to static factories on one error class per
                   concept: --plan writes error-factories.plan.json, where each class is given its concept;
                   --apply follows it (classes, specs, every usage, "stack.refusals" in the config)
  value-objects    moves the value objects of a project from a Result to factories that return the value or
                   throw: every create returning Result<T, E> returns T, err(..) is thrown, unwrap(..) of
                   them goes, specs assert expectRefusal(() => ..), "stack.valueObjects" becomes throwing
  controllers      moves the function routes of a project, or of one context, to controller classes: each
                   <name>.route.ts becomes <resource>/<name>/<name>.controller.ts behind the route group of
                   its resource, its schema files and its spec follow; a context is turned whole or not at all
  doctor           what an upgrade left to do: the scripts, the packages of the kit (at the ranges of this
                   version) and the agent permissions this version writes that the project lacks or writes
                   otherwise; init adds what is missing; --strict exits 1 while something is missing
  describe         one context as facts: use cases, routes, events, ports, policies, gateways, dependencies
  status           the next step of docs/architecture/plan.md, the slices of docs/architecture/slices.md by
                   status and by owner, each row not done ready on the trunk (its dependencies done), ready
                   on a branch (the others briefed to a worker with commits ahead of its base) or waiting
                   (with the ids it waits for), and the TODO(domain), TODO(platform), it.todo and TODO(review)
                   left in each context; --workers shows instead each worktree holding .ddd-ts-kit/worker.json (branch,
                   context, rows, base, commits ahead, files changed since the base, its report), then the
                   contexts and the files more than one worker holds
  sdk              the typed client of each document of the contract, a workspace package under
                   clients/<document> without runtime dependency: typed errors keyed by the error codes,
                   credentials per security scheme; records "sdk" in the config the first time, wires the
                   scripts (docs:generate regenerates it, docs:check compares it, ci:build builds it);
                   --check writes nothing and exits 1 while a client differs from its contract
  todo             those markers as file:line, in the project or in one context
  plan-waves       the rows of slices.md not done, of the project or of one context, in waves (wave 1: every
                   dependency done; wave n: the others in earlier waves), each wave cut into batches of one
                   owner, one or two rows on one aggregate, with the worker-scope command that briefs each,
                   the batches of a wave likely to touch the same files (same aggregate in Start with, or
                   unknown when it names none), and the merge order; a cycle, a dependency on an unknown id
                   or a row without owner is reported alone, and exits 1
  worker-scope     a git worktree on the branch build/<context> (by default ../<project>-<context>), cut from
                   --base <ref> (by default the current branch, refused from a worker's worktree), its
                   .ddd-ts-kit/worker.json, and the briefing of the worker of that context; --rows <id,...>
                   briefs those rows of slices.md only, with their rules; an existing worktree or branch
                   that does not contain the base is refused
  verify-slice     closes a slice before its commit, in one run: the regenerate script, check on the files
                   changed since --since (new ones included), the test script for the context; then the
                   changed files past 300 of the 350 lines, the paths of the slice to stage (its context, an
                   end-to-end spec, a working migration, the derived files git tracks) and every other
                   changed path, left out and never to stage with it; exits 1 while a step fails
  --commit-size    the files and lines about to be committed against "commit" in the config (20 files and
                   600 lines by default, generated files not counted); --staged reads the index only;
                   advisory, --strict exits 1 when over
  --stored-events  docs records the shape of each version of the stored events in stored-events.lock.json,
                   never rewriting a recorded one: run it once the shape of a version is the one to store;
                   docs --check fails while a declared version is not recorded
  --sdk            init records "sdk" in the config and generates the clients with the project
  --local-only     generate refuses, and writes nothing, when the kind would write outside its context;
                   "generate --help --json" says which kinds do`;
