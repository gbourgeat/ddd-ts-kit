export const NOTES = `  affected         what a pull request has to run: the contexts a change set reaches through the context
                   map (a changed context and the contexts downstream of it), as filters for the test
                   runner and the linter; everything when a shared path changed or without --base
  build-aliases    after the compiler: rewrites the import aliases left in the emitted .js and .d.ts files
                   into relative paths, so that plain node runs the output (tsconfig.build.json by default)
  drizzle-generate the db:generate of a Drizzle project: drizzle-kit generate --name, which without a terminal
                   fails and names the fix when drizzle-kit would ask whether a column or table is renamed,
                   where drizzle-kit alone writes nothing and exits 0; then formats the snapshot and the
                   journal it wrote with the Biome or Prettier of the format script, and warns when the
                   SQL changes a primary key in an order that fails on PostgreSQL (exit code unchanged);
                   --replay, after merging the trunk into a branch when both added migrations: deletes
                   the migrations of the branch that --base <ref> (origin/main by default) does not have,
                   with their snapshots and journal entries, then generates each again on top, in order,
                   under its name (working- dropped outside a worker's worktree, a custom one keeping
                   its SQL); refused while the journal holds conflict markers or when two of them change
                   the schema
  error-factories  moves a project from one class per error to static factories on one error class per
                   concept: --plan writes error-factories.plan.json, where each class is given its concept;
                   --apply follows it (classes, specs, every usage, "stack.refusals" in the config)
  value-objects    moves the value objects of a project from a Result to factories that return the value or
                   throw: every create returning Result<T, E> returns T, err(..) is thrown, unwrap(..) of
                   them goes, specs assert expectRefusal(() => ..), "stack.valueObjects" becomes throwing
  controllers      moves the function routes of a project, or of one context, to controller classes: each
                   <name>.route.ts becomes <resource>/<name>/<name>.controller.ts behind the route group of
                   its resource, its schema files and its spec follow; a context is turned whole or not at all
  doctor           what an upgrade left to do: the scripts, the packages of the kit (at the ranges of this
                   version) and the agent permissions this version writes that the project lacks or writes
                   otherwise, and the git hooks (the lefthook: line of lefthook.yml, the pre-commit hook of
                   lefthook in this clone); init adds what is missing, hooks:install the hook; --strict
                   exits 1 while something is missing, never for a hook this clone has not installed
  describe         one context as facts: use cases, routes, events, ports, policies, gateways, dependencies
  status           the next step of docs/architecture/plan.md, the slices of docs/architecture/slices.md by
                   status and by owner, each row not done ready on the trunk (its dependencies done), ready
                   on a branch (the others briefed to a worker with commits ahead of its base) or waiting
                   (with the ids it waits for), and the TODO(domain), TODO(platform), it.todo and TODO(review)
                   left in each context; --workers shows instead each worktree holding .ddd-ts-kit/worker.json (branch,
                   context, rows, base, commits ahead, dependencies not installed, files changed since the base,
                   its report), then the contexts and the files more than one worker holds
  sdk              the typed client of each document of the contract, a workspace package under
                   clients/<document> without runtime dependency: typed errors keyed by the error codes,
                   credentials per security scheme; records "sdk" in the config the first time, wires the
                   scripts (docs:generate regenerates it, docs:check compares it, ci:build builds it);
                   --check writes nothing and exits 1 while a client differs from its contract
  todo             those markers as file:line, in the project or in one context
  plan-waves       the rows of slices.md not done, of the project or of one context, in waves (wave 1: every
                   dependency done; wave n: the others in earlier waves), each wave cut into batches of one
                   owner, one or two rows on one aggregate, with the worker-scope command that briefs each,
                   the batches of a wave likely to touch the same files (same aggregate in Start with, or
                   unknown when it names none), and the merge order; a cycle, a dependency on an unknown id
                   or a row without owner is reported alone, and exits 1
  worker-scope     a git worktree on the branch build/<context> (by default ../<project>-<context>), cut from
                   --base <ref> (by default the current branch, refused from a worker's worktree), its
                   .ddd-ts-kit/worker.json, and the briefing of the worker of that context; --rows <id,...>
                   briefs those rows of slices.md only, with their rules, the documents of their design and
                   the names that design cites the base does not have (see cited); a worktree it creates gets
                   the clean install of the package manager (npm ci), its time in the notes, unless
                   --no-install; an existing worktree or branch that does not contain the base is refused
  verify-slice     closes a slice before its commit, in one run: the regenerate script, check on the files
                   changed since --since (new ones included), the test script for the context; then the
                   changed files past 300 of the 350 lines, the paths of the slice to stage (its context, an
                   end-to-end spec, a working migration, the derived files git tracks) and every other
                   changed path, left out and never to stage with it; the merges since --since, as
                   verify-merge checks them, reported without failing the slice in this version (a later
                   minor version fails it); exits 1 while a step fails; then the names the slice removes
                   that the design of a row not done still cites (never a failure)
  cited            the names the design of rows not done cites as code (paths, classes, Class.member) that
                   the code does not have: those the history of --base removed (with the commit and the
                   successor), the places the canonical tree refuses, and a name never there whose close
                   name of the same part arrived after the line was written; planned names stay silent.
                   The design of a row: its cells and rule lines in slices.md, a section of a document of
                   docs/architecture whose heading names it, a document that names it or that its rule
                   line links to. Default: every row not done, of the context when given, at the current
                   branch. --removed-since <ref>: the names a change removes, from the merge base to the
                   working tree, that such a design cites. Reads only, exits 0
  verify-merge checks them, reported without failing the slice in this version (a later
                   minor version fails it); exits 1 while a step fails
  verify-merge     what the merges of a branch lost, read from git only: every merge commit since --since
                   (by default the base of .ddd-ts-kit/worker.json, then origin/HEAD, then origin/main) and
                   the merge in progress (its result: the index and the working tree), or one <commit>; a
                   squash commit takes --theirs <head of the branch it took in>. Errors: a line one side
                   added or both kept missing from the result (whitespace, a line laid out again, a move
                   to another file and imports merged into one statement aside), a file neither side
                   deleted gone from the result, a row of slices.md done on one side and no longer done or
                   gone, a test title or a spec file of one side gone, a migration of one side whose
                   description (name without number and working-) the result lacks, a conflict marker;
                   warnings: a line one side removed brought back, a line one side wrote where the other
                   changed the same lines or deleted the file (the merge chose), a line the merge replaced
                   by lines of its own. Derived files, files a tool says it wrote, migrations, lockfiles
                   and slices.md are left out of the lines. The base is --base, else the Merge-Base:
                   trailer of the merge, else git merge-base; entries of a Lost-Accepted: <file:line>,...
                   trailer are listed and never fail, nor what a later commit restored; silent and exit 0
                   without a merge, exit 1 on an error; --warn prints the same and exits 0, as the
                   pre-push hook of init runs it in this version (a later minor version blocks the push)
  --commit-size    the files and lines about to be committed against "commit" in the config (20 files and
                   600 lines by default, generated files not counted); --staged reads the index only;
                   advisory, --strict exits 1 when over
  --stored-events  docs records the shape of each version of the stored events in stored-events.lock.json,
                   never rewriting a recorded one: run it once the shape of a version is the one to store;
                   docs --check fails while a declared version is not recorded
  --sdk            init records "sdk" in the config and generates the clients with the project
  --local-only     generate refuses, and writes nothing, when the kind would write outside its context;
                   "generate --help --json" says which kinds do`;
